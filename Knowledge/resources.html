					<br>	
					explains computer architectures concepts from basics using MIPS architecture and C <br>
					builds processor with cache and works on basics of necessary topics <br>
					not very information dense, watch at least at 1.25x speed <br>

					<br>	
					explain computer architecture concepts with MIPS and C <br>
					quite fast paced course with a lot of links to papers <br>
					quite information dense by covering many areas <br>

					<br>	
					quite information dense and many interesting papers <br>
					atypical topics, covers memory, mulithreading and interconnects <br>
					but Mutlu spends a lot of time on philosophy of why and how to do something <br>

					<br>	
					covers more typical info related to computer architecture: pipelines, OOE, memory, parallelism <br>
					useful discussion sessions <br>
					not very information dense but has interesting papers on website <br>

					INTERMEDIATE <br>
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAwxTw4SYaPmqpjgrmf4-DGlaeV0om4iP"> video (link is only to part1, there are 6 parts available on youtube) </a> <br> 
					<br>	
					very information dense and in depth about many concepts <br>
					after theory there are questions to answer which verify understanding </br>
					only downside is inconvienient short format <br>

			<ul> 
				<li> 
					<h3 id="computer_architecture>books>coad"> Computer Organization and Design </h3>
					INTRODUCTORY <br>
					link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=rlkXwAEACAAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=rlkXwAEACAAJ</a><br>
					<br>	
					used by many university coures <br>
					covers basics of computer architecture using arm/mips/riscv (depends on edition) <br>
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3 id="computer_architecture>books>csapp"> Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</h3> 
					INTRODUCTORY <br>
					link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n4ZAQAAIAAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=4n4ZAQAAIAAJ</a><br>
					<br>	
					first six chapters are about computer architecture related topics, rest are about software <br>
					very good book, problems appear between text to immediately provoke thinking (global edition contains errors) <br>
					however as the name suggests it is mainly focused on <u>programmer's</u> perspective so some details and more advanced HW concepts are ommited<br> 
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3 id="computer_architecture>books>dce"> Digital Computer Electronics </h3> 
					INTRODUCTORY <br>
					link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGVTAAAAMAAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=HGVTAAAAMAAJ</a><br>
					<br>
					covers basics of logic gates, transistors, boolean algebra, later switches to computer architecture features  <br>
					old book, does not go in depth, presents few simple custom architectures <br>
					later chapters are more focused on computer architecture and relate features to existing microprocessors <br>
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3 id="computer_architecture>books>mpdfosp"> Modern Processor Design: Fundamentals of Superscalar Processors </h3> 
					INTERMEDIATE <br>
					link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffQqAAAAQBAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=ffQqAAAAQBAJ</a> <br>
					<br>	
					a bit dated but covers topics for superscalar execution in great depth, but some, especially later, are barely touched <br>	
					has interesting HW problems that are more mostly thought provoking and not pure computation or checking answer in the book <br>	
					2 chapters are dedicated to explain 2 real world architectures in quite depth <br>	
					1 chapter contains speedrun description of many architectures with references to deeper explanations <br>	
				</li>
				<li> 
					<h3 id="computer_architecture>books>caaqa"> Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach </h3> 
					INTERMEDIATE <br>
					link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=cM8mDwAAQBAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=cM8mDwAAQBAJ</a> <br>
					<br>	
					not worth the time, dont read, covered topics are not explained deeply <br>	
					for example: I've made 35 lines from chapter 4.3 "Vector architecture" while I've made only 26 lines from appendix G "Vector Processors in <u>More</u> Depth" 
					26 lines for appendix is, beyond words, low <br>
					any deeper explanation in this book can be found in any resource above <br>
					read ONLY appendix L from 6th edition, funnily enough, the only good part of the book looks completely different from the rest of it <br>
