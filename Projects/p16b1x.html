		As the name suggests, it is 16bit CPU. <br>
		The ISA is very simple and does not even utilize all space for instructions. <br>
		Design is pretty much copycat of what was shown in course because that was all I knew at that time.  It was simple enough to get everything working without thinking about design too much, this was never again possible in the future.  <br>
		Instruction and data memory are separated so every instruction takes exactly 1 cycle. <br>
		<br>
		CPU was implemented in logisim and I was assembler for longer than I would like to admit before writing proper one in c++. <br>

		<h3> Example Program </h3>
		<pre class=code>

	mvi 	A, 0x0
	mvi 	B, 0x1

#(n + 2)th fib number
	mvi 	E, 0x5
#to be able to subtract one
	mvi 	F, 0x1

LABEL loop
	#C = A + B
	mvr 	C, A
	add 	C, B

	#A = B
	mvr 	A, B
	#B = C
	mvr 	B, C

	#M[0] = C
	str 	C, ZERO

	#E -= F
	sub 	E, F

	jnz 	E, loop

		<hr> <h2 id=the_good> THE GOOD </h2>
		<p>
			The very best thing is that it works. <br>
		</p>

		<p>
			It is hard to find any other thing that is noteworthy good.  At the time I was proud of using mux to select correct control signals instead of combinational logic. Later I realized that not only this is quite common, I should've used ROM component directly. <br>
		</p>

		<hr> <h2 id=the_bad> THE BAD </h2>

		<p>
			The worst thing in this design is that somehow a bit was skipped. <br>
			Instruction format shown previously has bits 11:8 assigned for Rd, it is 4 not 3, Rs has bits 7:6, it is 2, not 3.  
			Correct thing would be Rd - 11:9, Rs - 7:5.  
			For r-format it's not so bad as total bit count stays the same, but immediate has wasted bit for no reason. 
			Since r-format and i-format have unused bits then this additional bit could be used to select between reg/immediate as second operand and it would be way more convientient to code. 
			Later designs fixed this issue in exactly this way. <br>
			I became aware of this while wiring control, I was tired already so I decided that I do not care. <br>
		</p>

		<p>
			Zero register is completely useless and terribly inefficient idea for cpu with 8 registers in total. <br>
			It was kind of needed because of lack of immediate operand for every instruction (see paragraph above).  Nonetheless, if it was needed then simple <span class="code">mvi Rd, 0</span> would suffice and would not waste a register.
		</p>

		<hr> <h2 id=the_ugly> THE UGLY </h2>

		<p>
			ISA mentions SP but it was not used. <br>
			Similarly local isa.txt mentions memory regions but it was never implemented. <br>
		</p>

		<p>
			Seperated data and instruction memory was ok at that time but was suboptimal and later designs changed it. <br>
			<span class="comment">//In fact, main goal of the 2nd iteration was to unify memory and fix terrible mistakes here. </span><br>
		</p>

		<p>
			0x0000 should not have been <span class="code">mvr Z, Z</span> becaues of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_slide">NOP slide</a>. <br>
			Unfortunatelly I became aware of this fairly recently <span class=comment>/*as of writing this post*/</span> and so next 2 designs also feature this problem. 
			This is not that bad for architecture that was not designed for serious use which is why it's in this section and not THE BAD.<br>
