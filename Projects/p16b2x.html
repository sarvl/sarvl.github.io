			As with <a href=./p16b1x.html>previous design</a>, this CPU was initially done in logisim. <br>
			This time there were no major flaws in the ISA, general layout was somewhat inspired by <a href="../Knowledge/resources.html#computer_architecture>books>dce">SAP from Digital Computer Electronics</a> (same thing that Ben Eater used for <a href=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU>8 bit computer</a>). 
			Pretty much everything that had to be fixed from previous design, was fixed <br>
			As the note near ROM/RAM (and as some features of <a href=#isa>ISA, described below</a>) suggests, project was not fully complete then <span class=comment>/*or ever*/</span>.  <br>

			<br>

			New circuitry allowed instructions to execute for 2 cycles which is essential for unified data and instruction memory. 
			Most instructions execute in 1 cycle as in previous iteration, but loads and stores take 2 cycles. 
			During 1st they access data, during 2nd they access next instruction <br>

			<br>
			First major-ish project in VHDL so code is not as good as it should be, entire project is in single file, including tests. <br>
			The implementation does not have multicycle instructions for simplicity, same as first iteration of the entire project. <br>

	AAAABBBC XXXXXXXX

	AAAA - opcode
	BBB  - Rd id
	C    - if 1 then second operand is immediate, otherwise it is register

	X4   - imm4
	X8   - imm8

	Xn means rightmost n bits of X

		<pre class=code>

	mov 	R0, 0

	#computes nth fib number
	mov 	R7, 9

	mov 	R0, R0 #nop for assembler to place label correctly

		<hr> <h2 id=unified_memory> UNIFIED MEMORY </h2>
		<p>
			The main goal of this project was to unify memory <br>
			Unfortunately I do not remember attemps too well but the entire approach was very convoluted and ultimately could not work.
			Idea <span class=comment>/*as much as I remember*/</span> was to check whether data is already out and if so switch address (during the same cycle).
			This cannot work because there is nothing that stores the first result so a register has to be added. 
			But a register cannot just store data whenever and has to wait for clock so the only solution is to have multicycle operation. <br>
			Note 1: There is another slight problem with checking availability of data - logisim RAM outputs data almost immediattely and does not signal whether it is ready. <br>
			Note 2: Even with latch (which does not update on edge) something like clock has to be used to decide when to update that latch. <br>
			Note 3: Updating on half cycle works too but that behaves identically (from digital logic POV) as twice as fast clock. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			After taking long break and accepting multicycle operation, unified memory worked pretty much instantly. <br>
			CPU was not designed with more than 1 CPI in mind and it was kind of hacked in. 
			Each instruction has <span class=code>last cycle</span> in control signals and if it is set then instruction is fetched to <b>I</b>nstruction <b>R</b>egister, this is usually the case. 
			If it is NOT set then IR is not updated and '1' is written to additional 1b register acting as current-cycle register.
			This external register is rather annoying to work with, next designs fixed this problem by properly incorporating notion of execution cycle. <br>
			Use of Async reset here was some wild thinking done my part. <br>

		<hr> <h2 id=vhdl> VHDL </h2>
		<p>
			VHDL here was mostly like processor design of the 16b1x - giant pile of mess, not knowing what I am doing and trying to make things work. <br>
			921 lines of entities with their testbenches and CPU.  
			Most of which is VHDL boilerplate <span class=comment>/*that part did not change in 16b3x*/</span> and actual logic is simple, CPU body (connections between components and logic) has only 60 LOC, most of which are whitespace or VHDL keywords. <br>
			Other than that, it is almost 1:1 translation of first iteration. <br> 
		</p>
	
		<hr> <h2 id=the_good> THE GOOD </h2>
		<p>
			No disasters and fixed previous mistakes! <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Instructions were allocated properly and format is pleasant to write assembler for. <span class=comment>/*this time it was written almost immediattely, as it should*/</span> <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall layout is also much nicer to look at however individual components are mostly identical as in 16b1x. <br>
		</p>

		<hr> <h2 id=the_bad> THE BAD </h2>
		<p>
			No stupidly bad decisions and mistakes like last time, all are minor enough to land in THE UGLY. <br>
		</p>

		<hr> <h2 id=the_ugly> THE UGLY </h2>
		<p>
			Did not use ports even though they are somewhat specified in the ISA <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_slide">NOP slide</a> is still present and there is no <span class=code>halt</span> instruction so CPU always executes <br>
