		<h1> Computer Architecture Books </h1>
		The list is ordered in roughly recommended read order.

		<ul> 
			<li> 
				<h3 id="csapp"> Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</h3> 
				INTRODUCTORY <br>
				link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=4n4ZAQAAIAAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=4n4ZAQAAIAAJ</a><br>
				<br>	
				The first six chapters are about computer architecture related topics, the rest are about software. <br>
				Very good book, problems appear between text to immediately provoke thinking (global edition contains errors). <br>
				However as the name suggests it is mainly focused on <u>programmer's</u> perspective so some details and more advanced HW concepts are ommited.<br> 
			</li>
			<li> 
				<h3 id="coad"> Computer Organization and Design </h3>
				INTRODUCTORY <br>
				link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=rlkXwAEACAAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=rlkXwAEACAAJ</a><br>
				<br>	
				Used by many university coures, pretty good. <br>
				Covers basics of computer architecture using arm/mips/riscv (depends on edition) <br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3 id="dce"> Digital Computer Electronics </h3> 
				INTRODUCTORY <br>
				link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=HGVTAAAAMAAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=HGVTAAAAMAAJ</a><br>
				<br>
				Covers basics of logic gates, transistors, boolean algebra, later switches to computer architecture features. <br>
				Old book, not in depth, presents few simple custom architectures, it is a good idea to follow them and actually build one or two CPUs they present. <br>
				Later chapters are more focused on computer architecture and relate features to existing microprocessors, can be safely skipped. <br>
			</li>
			<li> 
				<h3 id="mpdfosp"> Modern Processor Design: Fundamentals of Superscalar Processors </h3> 
				INTERMEDIATE <br>
				link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffQqAAAAQBAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=ffQqAAAAQBAJ</a> <br>
				<br>	
				A bit dated but covers topics for superscalar execution in great depth, but some, especially later ones, are barely touched. <br>	
				Has interesting HW problems that are more mostly thought provoking and not pure computation or checking answer in the book. <br>	
				2 chapters are dedicated to explain 2 real world architectures in quite depth. <br>	
				1 chapter contains speedrun description of many architectures with references to deeper explanations. <br>	
			</li>
			<li> 
				<h3 id="caaqa"> Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach </h3> 
				INTERMEDIATE <br>
				link: <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=cM8mDwAAQBAJ>https://books.google.com/books?id=cM8mDwAAQBAJ</a> <br>
				<br>	
				READ ONLY APPENDIX L. THE REST IS NOT WORTH THE TIME, DONT READ, COVERED TOPICS ARE NOT EXPLAINED DEEPL.<br>	
				For example: I've made 35 lines from chapter 4.3 "Vector architecture" while I've made only 26 lines from appendix G "Vector Processors in <u>More</u> Depth".
				26 lines for appendix is, beyond words, low. <br>
				Any deeper explanation in this book can be found in any resource above <br>
				Read ONLY appendix L from 6th edition, funnily enough, the only good part of the book looks completely different from the rest of it. <br>
