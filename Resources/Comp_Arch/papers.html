		<h1> Computer Architecture Papers</h1>
		The paper order is mostly the same as I have read them, pick whatever you want. <br>
		All these papers should be easily accessible on the web but I decided to not go through the trouble of finding URL to each one, if by some unexpected sequence of events they are no longer accessible, hit me up and I'll figure something out. <br>
		<span class=comment>//I guess I could upload them here but I have no idea how legal it is to republish(?) research papers, probably not very legal </span>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b> uica: accurate throuhgut prediction of basic blocks on recent intel uarch </b> <br>
				Very interesting paper describing modeling of intel x86 execution pipelines from around haswell era. As a treat contains a lot of microarchitectural information.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> the mips R10000 superscalar microprocessor </b> <br>
				Describes Out of Order, Superscalar, RISC processor implementing MIPS instruction set. Great description of how the entire pipeline of a real world processor works.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> Very High Speed Computing Systems </b> <br>
				Categorizes computing systems based on execution and data processing (SISD, SIMD, MISD, MIMD), pretty interesting but many ideass discussed out of nowhere.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> Very Long Instructionn Word Architectures And The ELI-512 </b> <br>
				Introduces VLIW. Describes an extreme case of horizontal control on a specific example, includes software and hardware techniques to exploit parallelism.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> Architecture of the IBM system/360</b> <br>
				Introduces the concept of ISA shared between different implementations through design goals, then describes a bitt of system/360 in particular. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> There's plenty of room at the top, what will drive computer performance after moores law </b> <br>
				Not very focused, but mentions few techniques of exploiting performance and judges them based on applicability.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> Performance of the VAX-11/780 Translation Buffer: simulation and measurement </b> <br>
				Very specific, not much to comment on, good paper.	
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> The Case for the Reduced Instruction Set Computer </b> <br>
				<b> Comments on "The case for the reduced instruction set computer" </b> <br>
				<b> Instruction sets and beyond: computers, complexity and controversy </b> <br>

				First paper introduces RISC but all three nicely compose to read about how RISC was introduced historically - they mention its various tradeoffs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> google workloads for consumer devices: mitigating data movement bottlenecks </b> <br>
				Describes problems of performance at larger scale and their mitigation with Processing in Memory.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> validity of the single processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities </b> <br>
				Introduces Amdahl's law, short and unclear.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> an efficient algorithm for exploiting multiple arithmetic units </b> <br>
				Introduces Tomasulo's Algorithm - Out of Order Execution, well explained but lacks benchmarks.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> the stanford dash multiprocessor </b> <br>
				Introduces directory based cache coherence, interesting and understandable read, also describes processor as a treat.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> power struggles: revisiting the RISC vs CISC debate on contemporary ARM and x86 architectures </b> <br>
				Comparison of energy efficiency between RISCs and CISCs, a bit dated, I need to verify its quality.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> a characterization of processor performance in the VAX-11/780  </b> <br>
				VAX-11/780 benchmark, interesting read about techniques of benchmarking computing system AND about actual benchmarks.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> risc assesment a high level language experiment </b> <br>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> profiling a warehouse scale computer </b> <br>
				Performance characterization of computer at scale not known to mere mortals.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> In Datacenter Performance Analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit </b> <br>
				Analysis of TPU - coprocessor designed to multiply matrices, interesting read about TPU, performance characteristics, and coprocessors.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> a case for exploiting subarray level parallelism in dram </b> <br>
				<b> a logic in memory computer </b> <br>
				Processing in memory papers, introduce few simple and easy to implement operations.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b> vlsi risc </b> <br>
				Description of process of developing RISC on VLSI. describes few interesting features like register window.
			</li>
