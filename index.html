		<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>

		<p>
			I am sarvel :wave:.
			<a href="./Images/me.jpg">This is how I look.</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			20yo with unhealthy obsession about computer architecture and system design. 
			I have designed 5 ISAs <span class="comment">/*I think*/</span> and implemented them in at least 9 ways as digital simulation or on hardware. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Currently I am working on <b>p16b4x</b> which is probably final ISA from <b>16b</b> "family" that I worked on, later I plan on just expanding it indefinitely. 
			<span class="comment">//Which is one of the reasons why it is taking this long to even get it to working state. </span><br>
			Concurrently I am working on <b>mALUch</b> which is yet another 16bit ISA, this one is developed as part of my Uni Student Club. 
			<span class="comment">//More details soon!</span><br>
		</p>

		<p>
			My present long term plans are to bring at least simple implementations of <b>p16b4x</b> to ASIC and be able to use it as fully functional multi user computer. <br>
		</p>

		<p>
			I am a full time student of Electronics and Telecommunications. <br> 
		</p>

		<p>
			My "minor" interests which I pursued to some degree include: ASICs, FPGAs, high performance computing, electronics in general, operating systems, programming languages, math, algorithms, and physics. 
			Other than that I enjoy biking, running, and recently cooking. <br>
		</p>

		<br>
		<p>
			If you are interested in anything I wrote above or broadly speaking low level programming, hit me up!!<br>

		<h1> UPDATES 2025-10-14 </h1>
		<ul>
			<li> Added ABOUT ME section </li>
			<li> Adjusted writing to feel better - mostly turned bullet-point-like sentences into prose</li>
			<li> Adjusted maximum website size, should work better with larger screens and in the future I may use that space for something</li>
		</ul>
